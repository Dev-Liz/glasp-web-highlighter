## **Introduction**
If you love to take notes while reading online, you’d agree with me that switching between the article you’re reading and a note-taking app can be daunting! But what if you could have all these notes in one place and then easily copy them to your note app at the end of your reading? Glasp helps you do just that!

<br>

## **What Is Glasp?**
Glasp is a social web highlighting tool that allows you to highlight and take note of anything you read on the web. It is social because it allows others on the platform to see and learn about what you read and interact with your highlights.

You’d also see the highlights of people you follow, which you can comment on, save or share. Helping you build a network of like-minded people.

Glasp also allows you to see statistics of your web highlights, as well as that of others, helping you stay accountable for your learnings.
